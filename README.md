# Vue / Nuxt / Vuex - Example Code Project

> Example code for a simple admin overview using Nuxt, Vue.js and Vuex.

Vue is my "go to" framework whenever I need to throw together a simple, standalone web application. It's straightforward, lightweight and fast to get up and running.

Nuxt/Vue.js/Vuex is an awesome front-end stack and I feel the code I've put together in this mini project showcases the features I really love about it.

Feel free to clone and take a look around. Here's what you need to get it up and running:

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
